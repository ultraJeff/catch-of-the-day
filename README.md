# [Catch of the Day](https://ultrajeff.github.io/catch-of-the-day/)

Based on Wes Bos' [ReactForBeginners.com](https://ReactForBeginners.com), this app is the finished product. It utilizes:

* Create React App
* Firebase (for both social login and database functionality)
* Stylus

Within the app, you choose a store name for your "Catch of the Day" fish market store. If no one already owns this store, you are taken to a new page where you need to login using either GitHub, Twitter or Facebook.

From here, you can load the sample fishes or create your own using the form. You may also remove fishes from this panel as well.

Once there are fish added on the left, you can click to add them to your order (the middle pane). There will be some minor animations and the order ticket will update. Additionally, all of this data is persisted to Firebase and localStorage so that your data is saved between page visits.

Have fun!
